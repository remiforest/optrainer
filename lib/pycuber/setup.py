=======

PyCuber is a Rubik's Cube package in Python 2/3.
--------------------------------------------------

The cube can be revealed as expanded view in the terminal, so it's easy
to visualise the cube, just inside the terminal. (Not tested on Windows)

.. code-block:: python


    >>> import pycuber as pc

    >>> # Create a Cube object
    >>> mycube = pc.Cube()

    >>> # Do something at the cube.
    >>> mycube("R U R' U'")

    >>> print(mycube)

We also provided some useful tools to deal with Rubik's Cube formulae.

.. code-block:: python


    >>> import pycuber as pc

    >>> # Create a Formula object
    >>> my_formula = pc.Formula("R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'")

    >>> # Reversing a Formula
    >>> my_formula.reverse()
    >>> print(my_formula)

    >>> # Mirroring a Formula
    >>> myalg.mirror("LR")
    >>> print(my_formula)


    F R U' R' U R U R2 F' R U R U' R'
    F' L' U L U' L' U' L2 F L' U' L' U L

I'll add some documentations later."""
